## Acknowledgements

This template heavily builds upon the template for [AutoML-Conf](https://www.automl.cc), developed by Roman Garnett, Frank Hutter and Marius Lindauer, and generously open-sourced in [https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate](https://github.com/automl-conf/LatexTemplate). The bibliography style file, `mais.bst`, has been slightly adapted from the style file for [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/).
